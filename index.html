        <h1>Happy 3rd Monthsary</h1>
        <p>Hi mal, I'm very thankful for you na you still stayed with me in this relationship, even tho you're always thinking na dapat mag break us when the situation is not good, and I already said na it's a normal thing to happened in relationships and I'm glad na you didn't breakup with me, I know I'm not your dream boyfriend or whats but it happens that tayo yung nagtagpo, and I'm super happy tbh that I met you, I'm really happy with you, there's a lot of things na rin na di ko nagawa non then nagawa ko this past months with you and you're there that it just happened. you're there na parang ikaw yung support ko when there's a thing na di ko kayang gawin, you're just there na di ko minsan napapansin na you're doing it for me and I'm the one na slow brain to realize that, kaya thank you so much talaga mal. I hope magtagal pa us and kayanin lahat ng mga pagsubok nadarating sa susunod, I really love you mal. Happy 3rd monthsary!</p>
